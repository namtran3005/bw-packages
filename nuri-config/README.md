# nuri-config

## Why?
Configuration management is hard.
  * Multiple environments mean multiple `.env` files
  * `.env` files are a list of keys and values, they have no structure
  * No runtime validation (you can check for existence of environment variables, but not much more (easily))
  * No dev time help (autosuggestions)
  * How to populate secrets secrets safely (and for multiple environments, possibly with different encyrption keys and in isolated environments)?
  * How to allow developers to specify secrets without having access to these secrets?

  ## How?

    * Create a `./config` directory in your project root
    * Add a `default.yml` in this folder and populate it with your configuration
      ```yaml
      # example for `bunyan` logger config
      logger:
        name: my-awesome-project
        level: info
      ```
    * Create a class that represents your configuration using the amazing `class-validator to define validations
      ```typescript
      import { IsDefined } from 'class-validator'
      import { LoggerOptions } from 'bunyan'
      export class Config {
        @IsDefined()
        logger: LoggerOptions
      }
      ```
    * In the `index.ts` (or whatever your `main` file is) load the config
    ```typescript
    import { loadConfig } from '@barath/typed-config'
    import { Config } from './lib/config'
    import bunyan from 'bunyan'
    export const config = loadConfig(Config)
    export const logger = bunyan.createLogger(config.logger)
    
    logger.info('hello world')
    ```
